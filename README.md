# Typescript Validator

> A type-safe runtime validator for parsing unsafe data.

This library provides type-checked validator functions that help you take unsafe data (e.g. data from an API request) and validate it against your Typescript interfaces.

When used correctly, Typescript will throw and error if your validator function does not match the type that you are trying to validate.

## Getting Started

Install from npm:

```sh
npm install --save ts-validator
```

Write a validator function:

```ts


```
